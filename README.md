# Bus-Reservation-System-JAVA-
A Reservation system that allows users to view available buses, check seat availability, and make bookings. It uses object-oriented principles with abstract and concrete classes, encapsulating bus and booking details. The system prevents overbooking by checking seat availability before confirming bookings.
